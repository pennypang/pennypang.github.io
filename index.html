            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">When I read about the moon and Mars -- the conditions, the habitats -- I realized that almost all of the existing ideas involved taking materials and components from Earth and building with those materials. Taking 1 kilogram of material from Earth to the moon would cost hundreds of thousands dollars. It was clear to me that these ideas were not economically viable.</div>
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">Other approaches, like taking inflatables, also wouldn't work. Inflatables are made of polymeric material, like vinyl, so they won't survive long because the radiation on Mars is pretty intense. Radiation is the enemy of polymers, causing it to become weak and fragile.</div>
